Job Story #1 ("Navigate with Tab"):
When I'm using tab to go through the task app,
I want highlighting around the box I am on,
so I can be certain which action I am taking without taking said action,
because my mouse is broken and I don't want to waste time undoing mistaken actions.

Job Story #2 ("Delete with impaired vision"):
When I'm using my eyes to check my task list,
I want to be able to see the tasks clearly to distinguish them,
so I can delete the correct tasks after completing them,
because I am partially blind and it is difficult to distinguish similar colours.

Job Story #3 ("Read task with screen reader"):
When I am reading my tasks,
I want to hear all the tasks as I iterate through the list,
so I can remember which tasks need to be completed,
because I am blind.

Job Story #4 ("Editing tasks to correct spelling"):
When I am writing tasks for myself and others,
I want to to be able to edit them,
so I can correct any spelling mistakes,
because I make a lot of spelling errors and it is hard to read.

Job Story #5 ("Filter tasks by 'buy'"):
When I am about to go shopping,
I want to filter my tasks by the word 'buy',
so I can create a shopping list from all the things I must buy,
because I am in a rush and do not want to check through each individual task.
